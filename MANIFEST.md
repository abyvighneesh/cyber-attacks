## 🎯 CORE FEATURES

### Attack Simulations (4)
✅ Brute-Force Attack
- Tries passwords from wordlist
- Blocked by rate limiting
- Shows attempt progression

✅ Dictionary Attack
- Uses common password lists
- More efficient than brute force
- Defense-aware

✅ Phishing Attack
- Fake login page
- Captures credentials
- Redirects to real login

✅ Credential Stuffing
- Simulates multi-account attack
- Tests password reuse
- Demonstrates attack scale

### Defense Mechanisms (3)
✅ Rate Limiting
- Limits login attempts
- Default: 5 attempts
- Configurable

✅ Account Lockout
- Locks after failures
- Simulated enforcement
- Configurable timeout

✅ MFA Simulation
- Multi-factor auth toggle
- ~99% effective vs phishing
- Easy on/off demonstration

### Dashboard Analytics
✅ Real-Time Statistics
- Total attempts counter
- Success rate tracker
- Failed attempts counter
