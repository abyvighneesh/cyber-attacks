## 🎬 YOUR FIRST DEMO (10 minutes)

**Step 1:** Start the application
```bash
python app.py
```

**Step 2:** Open browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

**Step 3:** Click "Login Demo"
- Show password strength meter
- Type weak password: `123456` → "< 1 second crack time"
- Type strong password: `DemoPassword123!` → "847 years"

**Step 4:** Login with: `demo` / `DemoPassword123!`

**Step 5:** On Dashboard:
- Show Rate Limiting: **ON**
- Show MFA: **ON**
- Click "Start Brute Force Attack"
- Show: "Blocked ✓ YES" after 5 attempts

**Step 6:** Toggle Rate Limiting **OFF**
- Click "Start Brute Force Attack" again

## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT (5 min)

> "This is the Password Cracking Dashboard. It's an educational simulation showing how password attacks work and how modern defenses stop them.
>
> On the left, we can see a password strength meter. Watch what happens when I type a weak password. `123456`? That cracks in less than a second.
>
> Now a strong password. `DemoPassword123!`? That would take 847 years with modern hardware.
>
> Let's login with the demo account and look at the dashboard. Here we can see attack simulations. These buttons let us try different attacks.
>
> Let's run a brute-force attack with defenses enabled. Watch. The attack is blocked after 5 attempts. Rate limiting works.
>
> Now let me disable the defenses and try again. See? The attack succeeds. The password is found.
>
> This is what security professionals monitor. Every attempt is logged, every defense is tracked, and the data is analyzed for patterns.
>
> This teaches three important lessons: First, strong passwords matter. Second, defenses matter. Third, monitoring and logging matter."
